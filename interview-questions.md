# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

Your answer: `this` is the JavaScript keyword to refer to methods, properties, or any variables in an object from inside the object. If `this` is not included, then an undefined would be returned.

In a method, `this` refers to the object in which it is in. On its own or in a function, `this` refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, `this` is undefined. In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulates a desired behavior. Then, depending on the state of your application, render only some of them.

2. Props: Properties or Props for short, is a way for the parent class to pass data to the child class, but not the other way around.

3. JavaScript Events: A JavaScript event is any action done by the user or even when the page loads. An event occurs when the user or the browser manipulates a page. Examples of an event would be `onClick`, when a user clicks on something.

4. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes its design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. The structure of OOP is focused around classes, objects, methods, and attributes. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

5. Ruby: An interpreted general purpose programming language developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. It supports many programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
